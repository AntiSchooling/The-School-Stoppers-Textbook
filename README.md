# The School Stopper's Textbook
## A Guide To Disruptive Revolutionary Tactics for High-Schoolers

The following section is reprinted from the 'School Stoppers Textbook', a small section of the 'How to Revolt Handbook', the fourth book of.... 'The Blacklisted News', available for 13 bucks from the Youth International Party (Yippies). OK here we go . . . 88 ways to trash your school.

Liberate your life -- smash your school! The public schools are slowly killing every kid in them, stifling their creativity and individuality making them into non-persons. If you are a victim of this one of the things you can do is fight back.
This chapter is not written for people who are not yet sure whether school is good or bad. It is written for students that realize the way that compulsory education and grades destroy the natural curiosity so many children feel ... who realize how the tracking system keeps the poor people and minorities in our society on the bottom while keeping the rich and powerful on the top ... who realize the danger of teaching complete obedience to authority and who are fed up with the racism and sexism in schools. It is written for students who have 'gone through channels' trying to correct these problems and who are tired of helplessly waiting while the schools destroy more and more minds each day. It is written for young people who realize that because they are trapped in school they don't have a chance to learn what they need to know to create a free and good life.
Before trying any of the ideas in here you should think about the effect they will have in view of the situation in your particular area. Not all of them will be effective at all times in all areas.
